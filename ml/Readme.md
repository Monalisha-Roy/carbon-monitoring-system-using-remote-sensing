## Machine Learning Models

This directory contains training scripts for:
- Above Ground Biomass (AGB) estimation
- Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimation

Models were trained using satellite-derived features processed via Google Earth Engine.
Raw satellite datasets are not included due to size constraints.

The trained AGB model is deployed on Hugging Face for inference:
